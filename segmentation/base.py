        Use this function to predict a 2D image. If this is a 3D U-Net it will crash because you cannot predict a 2D
        image with that (you dummy).

        When running predictions, you need to specify whether you want to run fully convolutional of sliding window
        based inference. We very strongly recommend you use sliding window with the default settings.

        It is the responsibility of the user to make sure the network is in the proper mode (eval for inference!). If
        the network is not in eval mode it will print a warning.

        :param x: Your input data. Must be a nd.ndarray of shape (c, x, y).
        :param do_mirroring: If True, use test time data augmentation in the form of mirroring
        :param mirror_axes: Determines which axes to use for mirroing. Per default, mirroring is done along all three
        axes
        :param use_sliding_window: if True, run sliding window prediction. Heavily recommended! This is also the default
        :param step_size: When running sliding window prediction, the step size determines the distance between adjacent
        predictions. The smaller the step size, the denser the predictions (and the longer it takes!). Step size is given
        as a fraction of the patch_size. 0.5 is the default and means that wen advance by patch_size * 0.5 between
        predictions. step_size cannot be larger than 1!
        :param patch_size: The patch size that was used for training the network. Do not use different patch sizes here,
        this will either crash or give potentially less accurate segmentations
        :param regions_class_order: Fabian only
        :param use_gaussian: (Only applies to sliding window prediction) If True, uses a Gaussian importance weighting
         to weigh predictions closer to the center of the current patch higher than those at the borders. The reason
         behind this is that the segmentation accuracy decreases towards the borders. Default (and recommended): True
